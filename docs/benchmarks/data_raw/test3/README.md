# Test 3
Question we wished to answer: How does a DoS attack affect legitimate traffic?

We were sending 30 requests/sec as well as simulating a DoS attack.

CSV files contain in the first line the size of the attack, while the results contain the number of sent responses.
Each DoS attack size we tested for a duration of 60 seconds.
