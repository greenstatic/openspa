# Test 1
Question we wished to answer: What is the maximum DoS attack the server can defend against using different number of CPU cores?

Data was repeated for each setup (no protection, ADK feature and XADK feature).

CSV files contain in the first line the number of CPU cores.
And 180 measurements of the number of requests processed for each core.
